# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide that can be used for aspiring students who wish to learn or pursue a career in front-end development. The topics listed in the study guide have to do with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
To see more how JavaScript code is run, we are able to open the DevTools console inside the browser to view the JavaScript code that runs and which topic for us to study first.

## HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and serves as the backbone of any web page. It provides the structure and content for your web documents. You'll learn how to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.

## CSS

To see more how JavaScript code is run, we are able to open the DevTools console inside the browser to view the JavaScript code that runs and which topic for us to study first.

## Git

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code over time. It helps teams collaborate, manage different versions, and maintain a history of modifications made to the project.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that enables you to add interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. You'll learn about variables, control flow, functions, and how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to interact with your webpage.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can follow these steps:

1. <b>Clone the Repository</b>: If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. <b>Navigate to Main Branch</b>: Before starting your work, ensure you are on the main branch by running:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

3. <b>Explore the Code</b>: Take a look at the provided JavaScript code that randomly selects a topic to study and displays it in the console. The available topics are listed in the `topics` array.

4. <b>Select a Topic</b>: To randomly select a topic to study, run the `selectTopic()` function. The chosen topic will be printed in the console.

5. <b>Learn and Code</b>: Start studying the chosen topic. Refer to the study guide sections above for each topic's essential concepts.

6. <b>Update the Repository</b>: As you progress through your studies, feel free to add new features or modify existing code. Use the following commands to save your changes:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add your informative commit message here"
git push origin <branch_name>
```

Remember to replace <branch_name> with a descriptive name for your branch.

1. <b>Stay Updated</b>: If other team members are working on the project, consider pulling the latest changes from the main branch regularly to keep your local copy up to date:

```bash
git pull origin main
```
